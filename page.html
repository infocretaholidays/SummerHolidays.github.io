                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-white mbr-regular mbr-black mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Wedding tourism is booming in Italy. According to a survey conducted by the Centro Studi Turistici di Firenze, with 1,600 questionnaires and telephone interviews in industry, there were 8,779 foreign marriages in Italy in 2018, yielding over 436,000 arrivals (+ 6.8% compared to 2017), with 1.5 million overnight stays (+ 7.4% versus 2017) and more than 500 million euro revenue.<br>At each wedding, on average, about 50 people - relatives and friends of the newlyweds - come.
<br>The average total expenditure per marriage was EUR 56,890.
<br>The weddings evolve into short trips as the guests continue their holidays for several days beyond the wedding day.
<br>A typical wedding is celebrated in luxury hotels, mainly in the summer months (the most popular months are June and September).</strong><br></p>

The new measure has been in effect since yesterday, August 1st and already the first Turkish citizens to come to Greece have paid the price.
<br>
<br>The impact on the Evros economy is expected to be large, as the costs are certain that the average Turk cannot lift.
<br>
<br>Especially for a family of four, the exit fee is £ 200, or € 32.5. In the coming days, as we are in a holiday season, the first conclusions will be drawn as to whether the entry of Turkish visitors to Greece is affected by the imposition of the measure.</strong></p>

                                <p class="mbr-text py-5 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong><br>If your main goal is to find the cheapest airfares, then the key is to let flights define the destination, rather than the opposite. It may not always be possible to go anywhere at any time, but if you have some flexibility, you can become a bit spontaneous and travel to a destination you do not know much about! Check out below 6 tricks to book your cheapest flight tickets for your next trip!
<br>
<br>1. Compare search engines
<br>Do not rest on the services of just one search engine but compare the prices to many different ones. Sometimes it is better to go directly to the airline site.
<br>
<br>2. Travel when you get the least competition
<br>If you can, choose a date and time when your flight will not have much demand. Flights during the week, early in the morning and late at night will ensure you the cheapest air tickets!
<br>3. Create your own combinations
<br>If you are willing to make stops (and perhaps discover the city you will be in for a few hours), sometimes the flight search engines will not show you all the possible combinations that may work best for you. Take a look at each flight in detail, since it can be more affordable and more expensive.&nbsp;</strong><br></p>

                                <p class="mbr-text py-5 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>4. Track your flights
<br>On many flight search sites you can choose to receive an email when the price on the flight you want falls off. When the email comes and the price is low, buy the tickets as it goes up again.
<br>
<br>5. Close one position at a time
<br>The cost of two seats on a flight is more than twice the cost of closing one. If this is the case with your flight, then close the seats one by one to get the most cheap airfares!
<br>
<br>6. Change your browser
<br>It is a common secret that if you are looking for a flight very often, each time the price will be even higher. So look for the flight from different browsers so it does not seem like you're looking for it often.&nbsp;</strong><br></p>

                <blockquote><strong>15.7% of Spaniards are funding their holiday with some form of loan, such as consumer loans and credit cards, according to a study by iAhorro, a bank credit comparison firm.
</strong><strong>The alternatives to these two modes of financing are sufficient and for the right choice, each stakeholder must take into account all possible charges as they depend on many factors, some of which are the total amount of the loan, the repayment period as well as of course, the applicant's financial situation. This year, the Total Annual Effective Interest Rate (APR), which is the entirety of the loan to be paid in interest terms, reaches 20%.
</strong><strong>In general, there is the possibility of large bank loans in Spain, such as Bankinter, which gives loans up to 90,000 euros, while the repayment period can reach 96 months (eight years). Smaller amounts in shorter payouts may have a higher interest rate than larger amounts in long-term payback. For example, Santander Bank, Préstamo Expansión, for an amount of € 2,500 and a repayment period of 18 months, has an APR 20,48%, while the same loan of € 60,000 with a repayment of 96 months has an APR of 11,63%.
</strong><strong>Additionally, one needs to consider whether they can get a specific loan option as, for example, the Santander loan, Préstamo Consumo 1, 2, 3 is only given to account holders in the Cuenta 1, 2, 3 bank deposit account and the agreed interest rate is mainly dependent on the client's financial condition. Evo Banco, on the other hand, has loans whose interest rates are not very variable, which is around 9.27%. In addition, attention should be paid to any additional loan costs, as some banks have a commission of between 1% and 2.5% of the total amount received at the beginning of this issue.
</strong><strong>With regard to credit cards, the APR may exceed 20%. One that should be taken care of by those who want to obtain a credit card is if there is an extra cost to owning the card. Most banks do not charge, or charge little, a card if their owner is also a customer of that organization. For example, the El Corte Inglés credit card charges EUR 12 if it is paid on a quarterly basis and does not charge it if the payment is made on a monthly basis. Particularly important for the right choice of credit card, is the evaluation of the various discounts offered by each card.
</strong><strong>According to HelpMyCash, a business related to the aforementioned, household payments to repay their debts must not exceed a total of 35% of their income.&nbsp;</strong></blockquote>

The picture confirms our earlier reports on the trend of the tourist market that we have presented since October 2018.
<br>
<br>
<br>This is what the CEO of TEZ Tour Greece spoke to Mr. Manolis Apladenakis, who stressed that "the picture is clearly downward despite the efforts made by most tour operators and difficult to revert to the final number that will give all the tour operators arrivals. If July, August and September show better occupancy in hotels and stronger arrivals than in the previous quarter, the season will end at a loss even marginally. " 
<br>
<br>
<br>Asked Mr. Apladenakis about the image that TEZ Tour presents this year at both Greece and Crete level, he replied that "the image of arrivals for our company so far has not changed compared to last year we expect that in the next four months we will be able to keep on coordinated actions in a marginal, positive climate".

<br>It is worth mentioning that Heraklion Airport for June shows a total decline of 0.9%, namely 546,590 passengers to 541,536, the main indicator of this year's image.<br><br>Top 15 countries visited the most by Russian tourists between January and September 2018, excluding CIS region:<br><br>Turkey                  4,907     (+24%)

Thanks to air and sea travel, we’ve been able to traverse every corner of the globe and now cross continents in a matter of hours. Whilst this has led to a better connected global community and infinite discoveries, it has also deepened our footprint on areas that were previously untouched and the effects that tourism is having on the environment and climate change are colossal indeed.
<br>
<br>It’s no wonder, then, that the last couple of years has seen the rise of eco-tourism, with many finding ways to reduce the impact their adventuring has on the world around them.
<br>
<br>Though there are plenty of things we can do to help offset our travels, the responsibility falls to hotels and tour operators to clean up their acts and make significant changes to their environmental policies. Rather than wading through the sustainability ethos of every establishment you come across, there are several travel companies that are solely eco-focused, so you can book your next trip safe in the knowledge that it’s as ethical and eco-friendly as possible.</strong></p>
